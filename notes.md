#Git Notes

These are my notes on git

*`git init`: initializes repository version control system (dressing room)
* `git status`: tells us status of repo
*`git add` : adds files to be tracked (green room/curtains)
*`git commit`: dedicate myself to a version (goes onstage)

---

### Tracking Changes

*`git diff`: shows changes not yet tracked

```
git init
```

This is `inline code`
